Herakles stands over the defeated King Diomedes, his chest heaving with exhaustion. Diomedes, bloodied and battered, crawls backward, pleading for his life.

King_Diomedes: Mercy, Herakles! Spare me, and I’ll give you riches, power— anything you want! Just don’t kill me!

Hercules: *(crosses his arms and glares)* *"Mercy? Did your victims beg for their lives, Diomedes? Did you listen as they pleaded, as they cried for their\
families?
Hercules: No. You laughed at their suffering, fed them to your cursed beasts, and watched without remorse.
King_Diomedes: Please! I can change! I can—
Hercules: *(interrupts)*
Hercules: Enough! Your fate is sealed. Hades will pass judgment on you in the underworld.
Herakles turns his back as the mares, wild with hunger, descend on Diomedes, ending his reign of terror.
*Once it is done, Herakles kneels and bows his head.* 
Hercules: May the souls of the innocents you killed find peace at last. I pray that their suffering is avenged.
*He takes the mares by their bridles, their savage eyes now tamed by his strength.* 
Hercules: It’s over. Time to return to Eurystheus and put this labor behind me.
