Charon: *(in a hollow, echoing voice)* 
Charon: No living soul may cross the Styx. Turn back, mortal, or risk my wrath.

Hercules: *(stepping closer, his tone firm)* 
Hercules: I am Heracles, son of Zeus, and I have business in the Underworld. You will let me pass.
Charon: *(hesitating, unnerved by Heracles' presence)*  Your strength is… unnatural. Very well, Heracles. I shall ferry you, but tread carefully—the dead do not take kindly to the living.
*Heracles steps onto the boat, and they cross the dark waters in silence.*
