Eurystheus: *(with a sly smile)* *"Herakles, you’ve done well so far, but don’t think for a moment that you’ve bested me. Your next labor will take you\
to the very edges of the world, beyond any land you’ve ever known.

Hercules: *(calm but firm)* *"Name it, Eurystheus. No matter how far, no matter how dangerous, I will see it done.
Eurystheus: *(leaning forward)* *"Journey to the distant island of Erytheia and bring me the prized cattle of Geryon.
Eurystheus: These beasts are sacred to Helios, their hides gleaming like gold. But beware—Geryon is no ordinary foe.
Eurystheus: A giant with three bodies, he guards his cattle with the help of his herdsman Eurytion and a monstrous two-headed dog, Orthrus.
Eurystheus: If the beasts’ beauty doesn’t blind you, their protectors surely will end you.
Hercules: *(narrowing his eyes)* Your schemes grow more desperate, Eurystheus. But I will face these dangers, just as I have faced all the others.\
Your fear will never be my master.
Eurystheus: *(laughing)* *"We shall see. Off with you, son of Zeus. Perhaps this time, the gods themselves will abandon you.
