*(Hercules arrives in  the plains of Elis, his shadow long against the golden fields. As he approaches the gates of King Augeas' palace, the air begins to grow thick with the stench of the stables. Villagers hold their noses, whispering as he passes.)*
*(Hercules is led into the opulent palace of King Augeas, who reclines lazily on a gilded chair. Augeas is a rotund and disheveled man, clearly unbothered by the condition of his stables.)*

augeas: *(laughing as Hercules bows slightly)* "So, you're the son of Zeus? And you've come to clean my stables? The mighty Herakles, reduced to a dung-sweeper? How the gods must be laughing!"

Hercules: *(straightening, his voice even but firm)* "I am here to fulfill my task. But I am no fool, Augeas. I will not clean your filth for nothing. If I succeed in one day, you will grant me a tenth of your herd."
augeas: *(stroking his beard, intrigued)* "A tenth of my herd? Bold, aren’t you? But why not? It’s an impossible task, after all. You’ve struck a deal, Herakles."
*(He waves his hand dismissively.)*
augeas: "You’ll find the stables down the road. If the smell doesn’t kill you first."

*(Hercules nods and turns to leave, his face grim. he arrives at the decrepit stables, as he approaches. The sheer scale of the task dawns on him\: endless rows of filthy stalls, manure piled high, and a swarm of flies so thick it blocks the sunlight. Hercules pauses, covering his nose with his hand.)*
Hercules: *(grimacing)* "By the gods... Eurystheus truly knows how to humiliate a man."
*(He exhales deeply, steadying himself.)*
Hercules: *(to himself)* "But I am Herakles. This will not break me."
