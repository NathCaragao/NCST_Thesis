Hercules: Lake Lerna... I’ve heard tales of this place since I was a boy.
Hercules: They say it’s cursed, haunted by dark beasts and spirits. Seems fitting that I’d find the Hydra here.
Hercules: Alright, Herakles, focus. One more beast to add to the list. No beast will stand in my way!
Hercules: Let’s hope this Hydra is as terrifying as they say.
Hercules: The greater the foe, the sweeter the victory!
