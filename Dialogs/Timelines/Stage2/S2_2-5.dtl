scholar: You there! Brave warrior! Thank you for ridding me of that wretched wolf.
scholar: I’ve been trapped here for days.

Hercules: Days, you say? You must have had some rotten luck.
Hercules: I’m Herakles, by the way. And you?
scholar: Just a humble scholar, my friend. The wolf had been blocking my only escape.
Hercules: Fair enough. Well, I’m here hunting a Hydra.
Hercules: You wouldn’t happen to know anything about this house over there, would you? The wood is stronger than iron.
scholar: Ah, that hut... it’s no ordinary structure. It’s crafted from the branches of a blessed tree in Lake Lerna. I actually hold the key to it.
- Threaten the Scholar
	Hercules: Hand over the key, or you’ll be wishing that wolf had kept you company longer.
	scholar: W-wait! Please, no need for threats! Here, take it. I have no need for the hut. Just spare me!
- Negotiate with the Scholar
	Hercules: If I saved you from the wolf, it’s only fair you help me with the key. Don’t you agree?"
	scholar: You’re right, Herakles. You’ve done me a service, and I’d be a fool not to repay it. Here’s the key.
Hercules: One more question, friend. The vines blocking the Hydra’s lair – they’re tougher than steel. Any idea how to get past them?
scholar: Those vines are also from the blessed tree. Only the divine flame of Apollo can burn them away. You’ll find it inside the hut.
Hercules: Apollo’s flame, you say? Interesting. I’ll find it, then. Thanks for the information.
scholar: Good luck, Herakles. I don’t envy your task.
