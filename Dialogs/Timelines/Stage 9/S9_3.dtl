Hercules: *(breathing heavily, lowering his weapon)* *"No, Hippolyta. I swear it! This is Hera’s doing—she disguised herself as one of your own and\

Hypolita: Hera… That wretched goddess. I see now that you speak the truth, Herakles. But my honor demands I defend my people, even against lies. I\

Hercules:  *(nods solemnly)* *"Then we fight—not as enemies, but as warriors who respect each other’s strength. 
Hercules: I will not hold back, but know that I do not wish to harm you."*
