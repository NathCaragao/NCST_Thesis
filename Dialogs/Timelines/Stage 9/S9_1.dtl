Amazon_Guard: Halt, stranger! You tread on Amazon lands. State your purpose, or prepare to face the wrath of our queen.

Hercules: *(raises his hands in peace)* 
Hercules: I come in peace. My name is Herakles, and I am here to speak with your queen, Hippolyta.
Amazon_Guard: And why would the mighty Herakles need such a thing? Speak carefully, for your words may be your last.
Hercules: I undertake this labor not of my own desire but as penance. I wish only to speak with your queen, to explain my purpose. 
Hercules: If she wills it, I will leave without raising a hand against your people.
*The Amazons exchange glances, then lower their weapons slightly.* 
Amazon_Guard:  Very well. If you come in peace, we shall take you to Queen Hippolyta. But tread carefullyâ€”our trust is not easily earned.
